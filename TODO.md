- `Pattern.evaluate(exp: PatternExp)`
- `Pattern.assert(sexp: Sexp)`

- `Parsing` test quotes

- `Pattern.match(sexp: Sexp): PatternMatchResults`

- `ParsingError` -- report error in `context`

# after then

- use sexp to do a untyped lambda calculus
  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between functions with recursion.

- use sexp to do a simple record type
  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between recursive record and subtyping.
