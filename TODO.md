- `Parsing` setup test workflow -- with help of `PatternExp`

- `Pattern.evaluate(exp: PatternExp)`

- `Parsing` test quotes

- `Matcher.match<A>(sexp: Sexp): A` -- composable

  - API for shallow embedding -- use `Pattern`

- `ParsingError` -- report error in `context`

# after then

- use sexp to do a untyped lambda calculus
  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between functions with recursion.

- use sexp to do a simple record type
  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between recursive record and subtyping.
