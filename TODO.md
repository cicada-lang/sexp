# docs

- docs in readme

  - note that we do not need special API for matcher,
    just use functions -- `matcher<A>(sexp: Sexp): A`

# use sexp

- [use sexp] untyped lambda calculus

  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between functions with recursion.

- [use sexp] simple record type

  to learn about how to implement equivalence
  between recursive record and subtyping.
